                <h1>My Coding Journey üíª</h1>

                <p>It all started with curiosity. I still remember the first time I looked at a website and thought,
                    <em>how does this thing actually work?</em> That question quietly stuck with me until one day, I
                    opened a text editor, typed a few lines of HTML and CSS, and saw a basic web page appear on my
                    screen. It wasn‚Äôt much ‚Äî just a heading, a paragraph, a few colors ‚Äî but at that moment, it felt
                    like magic. I had built something that existed only because I decided to make it.
                </p>

                <p>As I dug deeper, I realized coding wasn‚Äôt just about writing instructions for computers. It was
                    about solving puzzles, breaking big ideas into small, logical pieces, and shaping imagination
                    into reality. I started exploring <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> next ‚Äî the part that
                    makes websites come alive. That‚Äôs where I learned the joy of making buttons respond, animations
                    move, and ideas interact. It was challenging at first, but every bug I fixed taught me more
                    patience than any tutorial could.</p>

                <p>Once I got comfortable with the front end, my curiosity took me to the world behind the screens ‚Äî
                    the backend. I wanted to know how data flows, how a website stores information, and how
                    everything stays connected. That‚Äôs when I started learning <span class="highlight">Node.js,
                        Express,</span> and <span class="highlight">MongoDB</span>. Building APIs, connecting
                    databases, and watching my applications come to life from both ends gave me a new kind of
                    satisfaction. It wasn‚Äôt just about design anymore ‚Äî it was about logic, structure, and making
                    things work seamlessly together.</p>

                <p>Of course, the road wasn‚Äôt always smooth. I spent hours stuck on silly bugs, confused by error
                    messages that made no sense, and questioning whether I was even improving. But then came the
                    small wins ‚Äî the first successful deployment, the first time my app actually worked end-to-end,
                    and the first time someone else used something I built. Those moments made every long night
                    worth it.</p>

                <p>Along the way, I discovered how tools like <span class="highlight">Git</span> and <span
                        class="highlight">GitHub</span> make collaboration possible, how frameworks like <span
                        class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> speed up design, and how curiosity never really ends in
                    this field. Every new language or library I explore feels like opening another door in a world
                    that keeps expanding.</p>

                <p>Now, when I look back, I see how far I‚Äôve come ‚Äî from building static pages to developing
                    full-stack applications. But more than that, I‚Äôve learned to enjoy the process itself. Coding
                    has become more than a skill for me; it‚Äôs a way to think, to create, and to keep growing. My
                    journey is still unfolding, and I‚Äôm excited for the next chapter ‚Äî wherever curiosity decides to
                    take me next.</p>
